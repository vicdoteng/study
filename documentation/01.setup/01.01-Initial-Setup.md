Goal:
-----

Setup a TypeScript "Hello World"

Requirements:
-------------

(Stuff you have to download and install yourself)

- node.js  
- yarn

Optional:
---------

- cmder

At command line:
----------------

```
yarn init  
yarn add typescript  
```
our compiler.
note: we're planning ahead here and including it as a dependency instead of a devDependency because we anticipate needing it for Angular2/4 JIT  

```
 yarn add npm-run-all --dev
```
tool to run multiple npm scripts
```
- yarn add rimraf --dev
```
tool to clean our build folder  
```
yarn add @types/node --dev  
```
ts typedefs for node. we might one day move this to dependencies, if we need anything in it for exporting  
```
yarn install
```

This will create:

- package.json  
- yarn.lock

Manual config:
--------------

- .gitignore  
- tsconfig.json  
set outDir  
- package.json  
setup scripts
